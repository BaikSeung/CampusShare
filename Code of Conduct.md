# CampusShare Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members of the CampusShare community, pledge to make participation in our project a safe, inclusive, and respectful experience for everyone. This includes fostering an environment where students can freely share, discuss, and build upon study resources while respecting intellectual property and ethical collaboration.

We are committed to building a platform that encourages open communication, constructive feedback, and meaningful contributions to support academic success and community growth.
## Our Standards
Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language, especially in public feedback spaces such as comments or discussions.
- Respecting diverse perspectives and experiences, including varying study methods or academic approaches.
- Sharing resources ethically, ensuring respect for copyright and intellectual property laws.
- Providing constructive, non-disparaging feedback to improve shared materials or community content.
- Encouraging participation through kindness and acknowledgment of others' contributions.

- Engaging in harassment, intimidation, or exclusionary practices within discussions or rankings.
- Exploiting participation ranking systems unfairly to gain undue recognition.
- Publishing personal information of others without explicit permission.
- Any behavior that undermines the community's goal of collaboration and ethical resource sharing.
